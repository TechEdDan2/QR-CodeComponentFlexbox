## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I am not entirely happy with this finished version. I think I tweeked the spacing a little too much here and there to make it look right and feel that there is a better way to produce this reproduction. 


### Continued development

I am hoping to continue to grow as a web designer and developer working my way through the remaining basic challenges and move on to the more advanced ones. 


### Useful resources

Flexbox Help (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with flexbox. I am sure everyone already uses this website.
